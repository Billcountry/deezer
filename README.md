# Deezer Client

My implementation of a deezer desktop app on electron. Integrates with the desktop to allow media keys control and background play.

I have no affiliation with (@Deezer)[https://github.com/deezer],just some guy still wondering why there's no official linux app ~while it takes less than 4 hours to build one~
The above statement is a little moot since I recently took another 6 hours to perform a few upgrades but totally worth it.

Built using: [Electron Packager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager)

To install simply run:
```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Billcountry/deezer/master/installer.sh | bash /dev/stdin
```
